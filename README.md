# electrumx-installer
A script to automate the installation of electrumx ðŸ¤–

Installing electrumx isn't really straight-forward (yet). You have to install the latest version of Python and various dependencies for
one of the database engines. Then you have to integrate electrumx into your init system.

`electrumx-installer` simplifies this process to running a single command. All that's left to do for you
is to customise the configuration.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run `install.sh` as root:

    git clone https://github.com/bauerj/electrumx-installer
    cd electrumx-installer
    sudo -H ./install.sh

See `install.sh -h` for command line options.
